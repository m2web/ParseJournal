Today is Tuesday, May 2nd. Little rainy when I first got up around 3:15 a.m. but then check the weather and noted it would pass. Temperatures are in the upper forties however it is windy with gust around 10 to 15 mile an hour and a steady wind as well. Therefore I knew it would be a little chillier as it actually feels the lower forties to mid forties. However still it eventually stopped misting and raining so I was good for at least four fifths or probably three force of the run. Now it is still Breezy but I am now walking South on Greenup street with my usual cool down. We had four days event there were some requests for estimates on a few changes within the admin section of on demand correspondence. Looking in her I noted again as we have been aware of for some reason some columns you not filter within the I thought it was because of the column or and that would be in the database, or in the fact that there may be spaces within the values but then I noted with other columns that have spaces do not have any issues until I'm not certain if it is a matter of these columns are the results of queries that are joins from of the tables but that should not matter. Therefore my suspicion is that it is a naming Collision Within knockout as the variables are attributes are named is other names also. So my thinking is to go ahead an experiment renaming for example within the return envelopes The Forum name we call it for might be well there's a form ID and another JavaScript model object that needs to be considered. Therefore I think if I simply rename the one in the return envelope model perhaps it we'll start sorting. I'm going to give that an experiment and see what happens with that today. So that is at least one thing I will do considering the day head. What I have been doing is looking at IBM integration bus and how to develop the messageflow. Primarily as I said before there isn't SQL query language that really looks a lot like Visual Basic. The reason why I'm not sure but again they have procedures which traditionally within database circles is not a foreign thing but there are also functions that return values within the structured query language. So I was trying to get a little more Premier with it but this is me some actual more productive directly at least things to do today. Also concerning the class at NKU all the assignments are in and now it is a matter of grading the final exams which will start coming in Wednesday evening or rather yes Wednesday evening on 334 perhaps even tonight but I think I had it set from the 3rd to the 5th and today being the 2nd so that means Wednesday evening on into Friday evening. So that's what needs to happen at least concerning the class is grading exams. Again it is windy and the wind is blowing and gusting fairly strongly at times. So I will be good to get back around and I'm almost at Madison now to head north and head back home. Will be good to get inside I will again look at the rain forecast and see if there's any forecast of showers and if not then I am good to walk to and from work today. Just will need to be mindful of the temperatures and perhaps where my black coat along with a thin toboggan at least on the way there. And as usual I can always slip the code in my backpack on the way home if it has warmed up enough. Looking ahead at this evening really nothing on the calendar which is good So the plan is to come back home and have a brief time in prayer with Jackie and discuss upcoming plans looking at probably the 13th which is a week from this coming Saturday to go to Ohio to visit mother's and Jackie can celebrate her dad's birthday as well. In the visiting a mother's it is noted that Mother's Day is within the next would actually be I think a week from this coming Sunday or maybe 2 weeks but none the less it is not too far away. So my thinking is to go ahead and plan on that I was going to buy something and have it sent to my mother but Jackie mentioned about us simply going up the 13th which is a Saturday and spending the day with them visiting taking flowers with us and therefore really having two gifts it will cost for just ordering for my mom. And also she could spend time with her dad. In addition to that in the first weekend in June we are looking to go and visit my grandmother Mimi.

Today is Wednesday, May 3rd. Again just finished up a run and I'm now walking South on Greenup Street. Considering what I've been listening to I'm still listening to Desiring God by dr. John Piper a book that I read sometime in the past. However it is a really interesting read in that I am again considering what how and why are otherwise more selfish and sinful but how is it that I have committed the pursuing of tremendous Joy at the sacrifice and or stopping on my own selfishness. I know that that is the issue given all the things that could be and whether or not simply because of the situation at hand. And this situation simply is that I am self centered and too easily pleased as I have mentioned before. So the question is day today what is it I should do for ultimate Joy. In serving God and in pursuing him? He alone is Joy he alone is the treasure he alone is the source of all contentment ever. But also in the fact is the being too easily pleased has more to do with the present and not postponing it and or delaying it until eternity. That is the issue I think it hand is it we are too short-sighted we are too much in the moment we are too much at home here. That were not the case then we would be more eternally minded and pursue God at all cost instead of our own temporary pleasures. And of course the problem is it's not those things don't matter and or that they don't provide temporary joy and indeed they do but what we need is a rather a desire to delay that and move forward in Ultimate joy in our pursuit of the Living God and serving him. So again what I need to do to take it step by step and another words hour by hour and consider what am I doing what am I pursuing why am I doing what I'm doing and to postpone the temporary and pursue the Eternal. Now this does not mean that I don't enjoy the temporary a given it is not sinful and given it is permissible but I still need to Value the Eternal and true Joy more. Well with into yesterday I mention that I needed to see what was going on as far as the Sorting or rather the ability to filter on certain attributes within the JavaScript objects what I found was is that it wasn't that a naming Collision the rather what it was was we were trying to sort on an attribute that was buried within another attribute within the JavaScript object. When I say buried I mean simply that it was a child of an attribute another words an attribute itself was an object and it was an attribute of that object that I was trying to sort on. Just by simply adding that as an attribute itself and then mapping it out of the object I was able to then sort on it. So I got that accomplished and was able to in to move back to looking at what it means to develop with the IBM integration bus toolkit. And specifically the esql language. What I will need to do this I was giving kind of a proof-of-concept assignment was to be able to read in a Json request and of course we would have to then map that or convert that to XML or soap and then do the query and then convert it as an output of Json. So I will need to start and to learn what is going on at least what nodes what items I need to drop into the messageflow how to develop them to read incoming messages and then to move from there. I was told that a contractor is also doing that working on the proof-of-concept and my hope is to get that from him instead of just starting from bear scratch. But meanwhile I went onto IBM's website and found an exercise that shows how to do that. And so I'm now starting the steps to go ahead and get that set up on my system. The issue is I don't really have a database in order to test with. So My Hope Is that I will least be able to get the exercise setup or at a minimum look at the nodes even though I can't debug with it which I'm not expecting to anyway so I guess the issues not really even to try to fix all the problems or rather look at what objects are on the palate and then look at the code behind a rather how the objects are coded and what nodes are used and then to go from there.

Today is Thursday, May 4th. And again we will hear from various Star Wars nerds May the fourth be with you. The last if we go then I'm now back from a run which I did not expect that would do this morning as previous forecast had the chance of rain in about 80 to 90% this morning. I got up it was 0 then change 2:30 and realized I could still finish before the actual Heavy Rain or even light rain started. So now I'm walking South on Greenup and have just completed that run that I was speaking of. Looking ahead at the day will continue to support as needed on demand correspondence although there's been little work of that. The thing this most recent would have been at the production password change for on the main course one and so ever that did not happen yesterday evening as the security person to do the change did not get on until later to do it by then we were completed. I think he failed to realize or probably I failed to point out that it it is a timely manner and a coordinated effort. In any event we will have to reschedule that particular thing. And so now too continue with the learning about IBM integration bus and the development environment what is called the toolkit. This is really just eclipse and it's IDE with some modified tools. So I am learning to use that but more specifically to actually do development from the ground up with it I do not know what some of the nodes are and/or items are on a pallet and then also how to utilize those items to actually produce a workable program that will actually receive and or respond to messages. My Sunshine is that will be the majority of what the total is used for Wii receiver request weave in call a database and then format the response and send it back to the collar over a particular protocol. And more than likely the protocol will be HTTP and that protocol or maybe a TCP protocol or even basically over IP but none-the-less some kind of protocol will be utilized within a request and then the message that we will format and send back on the response across that protocol. So these are the things that I need to learn how to develop both the receiving of the message which is the request manipulating it getting the request information forming a database query then the response from the database being formatted and then put back on a request and a proper format for the caller to consume. Concerning the NKU class already students are turning in exams which is good and so I will be grading those probably some this morning more than likely waiting until this evening to do them together both tonight and Friday night. Then once all the exams are graded then of course the submission of the grades that is not difficult to do now using Blackboard to actually submit the grades so that is the plan at least concerning items of work in general overview. More generally I have continued to listen to Desiring God by dr. John Piper. Actually I'm in the epilogue sections and noting that at is as valuable or maybe even perhaps more valuable than the actual content itself. But again with that stated of course having the content of the book as the foundation and then the epilogue becomes further explanatory text but I will say that it is that those epilogues sections this seem to really wrap it up and apply it to actual everyday thinking. Not saying that just looking at the content one cannot find things to apply practically of course one could, but what I am saying is that the epilogues really do I up and or bring into perspective all of those particular principles and points made in the actual chapters of the book. I think there's epilogues very valuable example I end of the run where dr. Piper was discussing the content and teaching of dr. Jonathan Edwards the great reformer and or Puritan and one of the original presidents of Princeton College. iPad Mini account say that he was probably is and at least is considered one of the greatest philosophical Minds that this nation has ever produced. With that stated I can see and say that we are looking at an account of dr. Edwards and the fact that he also considered the reward and joy in God the primary motivation to sacrificed to even die for the gospel. And again let's be honest if a reward even internal one is what is the motivating factor given our fallen this and weakness there is no way we can just maintain that as the only goal. When the fact is God carries us for his glory and it is that Glory wherein is the primary motivation of all things. So if we are motivated by God's glory for Joy than that is the strongest sure we could ever experience. Just as CS Lewis stated we are too easily pleased that is our problem we always go for the Lesser Pleasures because they are easier to obtain.
